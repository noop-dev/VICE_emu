dump8500_1588-coldstart/alresult[1-5].prg
-----------------------------------------

Dumped on Machine (unseen):
(five successive dumps directly after power up)
Unseen: "first one was cold, box was kept on, timestamps should be correct"
 (00:30, 00:38, 00:42, 00:48, 00:48)
[14:26] Unseen2 just noticed that the RTC of his sd2iec board actually wasn't set, so the timestamps of the ANE-LAX files from yesterday are actually the time when they were copied, not when they were created.
[17:13] _tlr: unseen: thanks!  So the timestamps are still somewhat related to the times?
[17:13] Unseen2: Yes
