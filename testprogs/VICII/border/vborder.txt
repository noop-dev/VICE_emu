vborder.prg:
============

Test to determine the correct cycle for vborder flipflop switch.

Instructions:
1. Adjust the first delay for the switch to 24 row mode with keys 'A' and 'S'
so that the upper/lower border opens. $33 should be the first value that opens it
2. Adjust the second delay for the switch back to 25 row mode with keys 'K' and 'L'
to determine the smallest delay with borders still open. That delay should be $09.
